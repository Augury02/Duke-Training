Adapters
	We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface
	Thurs we use a special device to give us the interface we require from the interface we have
	It is a construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to required interface Y


Implementing an adapter is easy: Determine API you have and API you need
Create a component which aggregates the adaptee
Intermediate representations can pile up: use caching and other optimizations
