Anakin: YOU TURNED HER AGAINST ME!?
Obi Wan: You have done that yourself.
(He glares at his former master as he decloaks, with Obi Wan doing the same.)
Anakin: YOU WILL NOT TAKE HER FROM ME!!!
Obi Wan: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.
Obi Wan: You have allowed this dark lord to twist your mind until now....
until now, you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.
Anakin: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan; I see through the lies of the Jedi...
I do not fear the dark side as you do!
